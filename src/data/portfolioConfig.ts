    intro:
      "I'm a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University of Victoria. My experience  with hands-on experience in composite design and manufacturing through the UVic Formula Hybrid team, and  at Ballard Power Systems and CanEV. My roles includes, but not limited to, thermal and structural analysis, FEA and engineering design. I am passionate about tackling complex problems and thrive in multidisciplinary, fast-paced environments.",
    experience:
      "in automotive and marine engineering, simulation-driven design, and robotics. I have a solid foundation in CAD, finite element analysis, and project management, and I'm always open to new opportunities that allow me to explore, grow, and take on new challenges in my next role.",
