    intro:
      'A recent UVic mechanical engineering graduate with quality co-op experience at organizations like <strong>Ballard Power Systems</strong> and <strong>Wiser Marine Technologies</strong>, I ramp up quickly in new environments and know which details need close attention.',
    experience:
      "I'm particularly interested in roles that involve <strong>composite manufacturing, automotive engineering, or simulation-driven development;</strong> postings involving any of those areas excite me greatly. I have a solid foundation in CAD design, thermal analysis, and project management, but I'm looking forward to a wider breadth of experience and deeper specialization in my next role.",
