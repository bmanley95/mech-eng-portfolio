Desktop-first CSS

All text is left-aligned

Two column layout

Max width of both columns together is 1280px

Left column is fixed, right column is scrollable with no scrollbar. Scrolling anywhere on the page scrolls the right column only

At screen width 1024px and lower, it goes to a one column layout

Only touch the CSS that is necessary to make the above a reality. There are other parts of the CSS that are correct already.
